I have completed the code analysis of the current project and identified the implementation logic for the four core functional interfaces (Home, Mini Game, Food Calorie Recognition, Check-in).

I will create a comprehensive analysis report and design proposal document in the codebase.

**Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Create Documentation Directory**: Ensure a `docs/` folder exists.
2.  **Generate Analysis Report (`docs/Interface_Analysis_and_Fusion_Plan.md`)**:
    *   **Interface Analysis**: Document the core functions, user flow, and data logic for:
        *   **Home Page**: Carousel, News Feed, Navigation.
        *   **Mini Game**: Camera/Keyboard inputs, Game Loop, Scoring, Leaderboard (`localStorage`).
        *   **Food Recognition**: Image Upload, Coze API integration, Nutrition Display.
        *   **Check-in**: Streak logic, Calendar view, Data persistence (`localStorage`).
    *   **Fusion Schemes**: Detail 3 distinct designs:
        *   **Scheme 1 (Functional Partitioning)**: A unified "Health Dashboard" aggregating data widgets.
        *   **Scheme 2 (User Task Flow)**: A "Daily Mission" guided flow (Eat -> Move -> Track).
        *   **Scheme 3 (Data Dimension)**: A "Health Score" system unifying calories in/out and consistency.
    *   **Evaluation**: Comparison matrix and prototypes (described in text/ASCII diagrams).

This document will serve as the "Analysis Report" and "Prototype Description" requested. You can then export this Markdown file to PDF if needed.
