I have analyzed the project structure and identified the "four functional interfaces" within `public/fitness_game/index.html`. They are:
1.  **Setup & Configuration** (Camera, Weight, Mode selection)
2.  **Game Monitor & Control** (Video feed, Skeleton overlay, Start/Pause controls)
3.  **Live Statistics** (Score, Combo, Calories, Accuracy)
4.  **Results & Community** (Leaderboards, Game Over summary)

My plan to fulfill your request is as follows:

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Interface Analysis
I will generate a detailed report analyzing the current state of these four interfaces, including their data flow, visual consistency, and user interaction logic.

### Phase 2: Design Three Fusion Schemes
I will design three distinct interface fusion strategies as requested:
*   **Scheme 1 (Functional Partitioning):** A "Dashboard" layout that optimizes screen real estate by grouping related controls.
*   **Scheme 2 (Task Flow):** A "Wizard/Stage" layout that guides the user step-by-step (Setup -> Play -> Result), reducing cognitive load.
*   **Scheme 3 (Data Dimension):** A "HUD/Immersive" layout where controls and stats are overlaid on the camera feed, maximizing immersion.

### Phase 3: Create Interactive Prototypes
Since I cannot generate `.fig` or `.rp` files, I will build a **high-fidelity HTML interactive prototype** (`public/fitness_game/design_prototypes.html`).
*   This file will feature a switcher to toggle between the three proposed designs.
*   It will use the existing Tailwind CSS styles to ensure visual consistency with the current project.
*   This allows you to directly experience and compare the interaction flows in the browser.

### Phase 4: Evaluation & Comparison
I will provide a structured comparison matrix (in Markdown table format) evaluating each scheme against the criteria of functionality, efficiency, consistency, and feasibility.

### Execution Steps
1.  Create `design_prototypes.html` with the three distinct layout implementations.
2.  Present the Analysis Report and Comparison Matrix in the final response.
